# slr-local-db

slr_database

aka everything is a localStorage entry

#### set-up:
   - database entry contains the names and column numbers of the tables
   - each table is a different localStorage entry

### to-do

1. database
   - create
   - delete
2. tables
   - create - there is only one database
   - delete
   - modify
      - create new columns
      - modify existing columns
      - delete columns
3. entries
   - add entry to table
   - delete entry
   - modify entry

4. misc
   - make columns have names - otherwise modifying tables is...weird
